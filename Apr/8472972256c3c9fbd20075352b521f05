South Africa’s most famous export to the US, His Excellency Trevor Noah did a segment on President Jacob Zuma on The Daily Show, so we can now hope that a few more Americans know who the president of South Africa is. Alas, Noah’s skit was not for the purposes of American education. So @Trevornoah was having Jacob #zuma on the daily show!! Hahahaha…exposed his mathematics!

And rightly so. For one, the bit about Zuma’s difficulty reading numbers is crass. But then this is Trevor Noah after all. And haven’t we been having this joke for a while now? Let me get this straight, people are hating on Trevor Noah for making jokes about Jacob Zuma on The Daily Show? — feeling confused — Cula  (@DJCula) April 6, 2016 Was Trevor too much this time? Watch it and decide for yourself.
