How awks would it be to have your job interview broadcasted live on national television? And then, have your files pulled out of the archives even Black Twitter hasn&#8217;t found yet. And then getting grilled for skeletons you forgot were hidden in the closet?The interviews of candidates hoping to take over from Public Protector Thuli Madonsela are under way in the National Assembly with only half of the candidates interviewed in the past nine hours. It&#8217;s going to be a long day in the office for some of the honourable members. Eight more candidates are to be interviewed within the remaining five hours, as the interviews are set to end at 11pm.We&#8217;re not seeing Baleka Mbete-induced levels of chaos but it s been lit.Smallernyana skeletons are everywhere!Everywhere!
