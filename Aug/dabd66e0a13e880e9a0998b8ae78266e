When Caster Semenya won Olympic gold last Sunday, the whole country lit up with pride &#8211; and its children were no exception. The Daily Vox visited a primary school in Johannesburg and asked a few grade 4s what they think of South Africa&#8217;s star athlete.First, we asked them who Caster Semenya is.[dropcap] [/dropcap]She s a woman of South Africa, she s one of our athletes, she s a middle distance runner that runs the 800m. Sometimes she runs the 400m and 1500m. [People are talking about her] because last week in the Olympics, she won a gold medal for South Africa. &#8211; Musabbihah, 10[dropcap] [/dropcap]She is a middle distance runner, she came first place in the 800m and won first place for South Africa. &#8211; Dutt, 10[dropcap] [/dropcap]Caster is a middle distance runner who believes that she can let her dreams come true and nobody can tell her anything. She can fulfil her dreams. &#8211; Nooriyah, 9[dropcap] [/dropcap]Caster Semenya won a gold last week at 2 o&#8217;clock. I didn t watch it [the race], I was asleep, but I heard on the news the next day. I feel so happy because she represented South Africa. &#8211; Mariam, 9What does Caster s gold mean for South Africa?[dropcap] [/dropcap]It&#8217;s very important for South Africa that she won a gold medal. She doesn t let us down. She inspired people to work hard and achieve their goals. &#8211; Dutt, 10~[dropcap] [/dropcap]Caster Semenya is a world champion for South Africa because she won a gold medal. It s important [for South Africa to win gold medals] because it makes us look famous, I don t know how to describe it. &#8211; Zahra, 10Can Caster Semenya be a role model? [dropcap] [/dropcap]Hmm, I don t know. She likes to run. She doesn t want to model all around. She s not a show-off, all she wants to do is run and inspire people. &#8211; Ahmed, 10How do you feel about Caster Semenya?[dropcap] [/dropcap]She means really a lot, she inspired people to be brave. She s brave because her dream was just to run, she didn t care about the government. All she wanted to do was run. - Ahmed, 10[dropcap] [/dropcap]I felt happy because she represented South Africa, she really worked hard and gave South Africa a good name. &#8211; Nooriyah, 9 [dropcap] [/dropcap]I think Wayde van Niekerk is better than Caster Semenya because he s a boy. - Yahya, 10, was not too impressed.But they know that it s not just Caster s moves on the track that have put her in the news[dropcap] [/dropcap]Caster Semenya was the first South African black woman to win a gold medal and she knows that the tests won t tell her what to do. She believes that she is a woman and she can race against other women. I believe she is a woman but she kind of looks like a man. South Africa thinks she is a woman and not a man. &#8211; Humayd, 9[dropcap] [/dropcap]Many people said that she is not a woman and she was in fact a man so she had to undergo many gender tests. It s not fair because she is herself and she knows if she s a woman or a man. She is an inspiration because she s courageous and strong. &#8211; Ameerah, 10[dropcap] [/dropcap]I think she s a brilliant runner, she doesn t care about her gender. She s brave and she s strong, she comes out, she trains, she wins her races, she doesn t care about what people say about her. &#8211; Yusuf, 10[dropcap] [/dropcap]Nelson Mandela fought for racial equality and Caster Semenya today is fighting for sports to end their warfare on women, on human biology, that she has fought for seven years. I think that her gender testing won t matter if she wins or loses because she s not going to listen to anyone who says that she must wait for her test results. All she wants to do is run and win for South Africa. &#8211; Zahra, 10.via GIPHYStay woke, kids.Editor&#8217;s note: The Daily Vox obtained written permission from the parents of all the children quoted in this piece.
