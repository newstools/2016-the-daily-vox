After what seems like a lifetime of teasing and broken promises, Frank Ocean has finally made good on his word &#8211; personally I never doubted him &#8211; and dropped Endless, a contemplative and immersive new visual album on Vimeo.Update: The video has been removed from Vimeo &#8211; sorry if you missed it. Frank Ocean &#8211; Endless from Audio Premieres on Vimeo.Endless features a number of big-name artists including Radiohead&#8217;s Jonny Greenwood, Arca, Jazmine Sullivan, vocalist Sampha and even James Blake.AALIYAH&#8217;S &#8220;LET ME KNOW?&#8221; What is #FrankOcean doing to me?! I hate this man, but I love him SO much! Kimberly&#8217;s Snapchat (@MvelaseP) August 19, 2016But that s not all! Endless is an entirely different album from the one he s been promising us since 2012. We thought it would be named Boys Don&#8217;t Cry, but some reports suggest he s since decided to change the name, while others say, we re due a whole other Frank album by that name.The new album, Blonde , was released this Saturday. The 17 track album has been sending people on a feels journey. #Blonde just took me on a journey Pink + White, Self Control The entire second half I&#8217;m emotionally unstable Kingsley (@kingsleyyy) August 22, 2016 But Frank though!
