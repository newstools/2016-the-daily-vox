So it s finally the holidays and not all of us are heading down to the beaches or getting our passports stamped. But you still have plenty of free time, so I recommend dropping the TV series and experimenting a with with anime &#8211; Japanese animation. Despite what impressions you have of anime, it s really quite a diverse and multifaceted medium. You re likely to find some aspect of it that really appeals to you &#8211; but it can be difficult to know where to start. So here s a beginner s guide into Japanese anime for your holiday binge-watch.*These are the shows I personally recommend you start with.The ClassicsThese are anime that you just have to take people s word for it and watch. Not because they re good anime, but because they ve achieved a status that goes beyond just the medium &#8211; they ve set some kind of standard for animation. Think of it as cultural exposure. But also, these aren t light watches and some of them &#8211; lookin at you Evangalion &#8211; will possibly leave you troubled and confused for a while.*Cowboy Bebop Ghost in the Shell (the anime movie &#8211; don&#8217;t you DARE go near the ScarJo remake) Akira Neon Genesis Evangalion Trigun Great Teacher OnizukaThe big-name shounen action seriesShounen anime is literally marketed towards young boys. Below are the series that form the bread and butter of what most fans get addicted to. The charismatic hero (usually a young guy) with latent and trained power, taking part in epic fights and a gradually progressing storyline. Think Dragonball Z but with varying contexts. If you have any friends who are into anime &#8211; they ve likely mentioned some of these.*Naruto *The Seven Deadly Sins Bleach One Piece Hunter x Hunter Fairy TaleStudio Ghibli and Makoto Shinkai productionsTechnically, Studio Ghibli counts among the classics. But given the amount of films produced, predominantly by their co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, this deserves its own section. Miyazaki is likely the most respected name in anime &#8211; some consider him to be Japan s Walt Disney. I ve included works by Makoto Shinkai because many are calling him the new Miyazaki. Shinkai s animation is aesthetically breathtaking and takes you on a journey.*Mononoke Hime *Spirited Away *Howl s Moving Castle Laputa: Castle in the Sky My Neighbour Totoro*Kimi no Na wa *The Garden of Words 5 Centimeters per Second Voices of a Distant StarComedy and romanceSo a lot of anime has become saturated by romance-comedies that feature a single guy surrounded by attractive women who dote on him for no particular reason. It s like a staple of every season. Along with this usually goes gratuitous fan-service which is pretty much cleavage and underwear shots, which is generally considered to make up for lack of plot and good storytelling. Regardless, there are still many comedy-romance gems that stick out. These are usually a lot more light-hearted and easy to watch.*Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun *Ouran Highschool Host Club *The Devil is a Part-Timer *Arakawa Under the Bridge *OreImo *Seto no Hanayome Nisekoi Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai The World God Only Knows Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu Gintama ReLife Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou Nodame CantabileAll the feelsJust accept that you will cry and feel the things that need to be felt.*Your lie in April *AnoHana *Grave of the Fireflies *Cross Game Clannad After Story Angel BeatsThe EpicsThese are larger than life, with complex plots, engaging character progression and storytelling that twists and turns. Go on an adventure in an immersive fantasy world.*Eureka Seven *Attack on Titan *Full Metal Alchemist Gurren Lagann Katanagatari Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works Re:ZERO Starting Life in Another WorldEdgy AFThis stuff gets quite dark and contains a lot of angst and violence, moral relativism and the less palatable side of human nature. Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.*Tokyo Ghoul *Death Note *Future Diary *Elfen Lied Darker than Black Berserk Prison School Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal Guilty CrownGenre-breakersThese could likely fit elsewhere, but I thought it prudent to give them their own category as each of these has achieved something incredibly unique and creative. This may be because the anime has done something new in terms of storytelling, or because it&#8217;s mixed genres or stepped outside the box in effective ways.*The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya *Samurai Champloo *Steins Gate *Welcome to NHK *One Punch Man Bakemonogatari Mushishi Mahou Shoujo Madoka MagicaSo there you go. Holidays &#8211; and pretty much every free moment from here to next December &#8211; sorted.via GIPHY
