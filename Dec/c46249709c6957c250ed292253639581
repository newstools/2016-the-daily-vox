With global donors, corporations, citizens, children, and key partners, the money was eventually raised and the construction began on 22 April 2014.The project is also special because it was spearheaded by three prominent women. Former first lady, Gra a Machel, who is the chairperson of the Trust, Ms Nana Magomola, the deputy chairperson and Ms Sibongile Mkhabela, the CEO of the NMCH all played integral roles in the planning and execution of the hospital project.In a media statement, Magomola said: For all of us who knew Madiba, we knew he was happiest when he was healing little hearts. This event, this moment, is a continuation of his love, and commitment to the welfare of South African children .Machel thanks Tata Madiba for the lessons he taught us, to love and care for and be in service of the children. #NMCHBringsHope Shaazia Ebrahim (@shaazzeea) December 2, 2016The hospital is neither public nor private; instead it has its own inclusive healthcare model that is centred around the wellbeing of children with a family-oriented ethos.It will serve children from all financial backgrounds and is in the process of putting together its team and testing its business processes and systems before its first patient can be admitted.The #NMCH will be the first on the continent to feature a children&#8217;s radio station: Radio Lollipop #NMCHBringsHope Shaazia Ebrahim (@shaazzeea) December 2, 2016The NMCH is supported by the Departmentof Health, and Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi helped Machel launch it on Friday.
