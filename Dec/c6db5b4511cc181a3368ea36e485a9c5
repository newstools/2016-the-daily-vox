We cannot deny, 2016 has been THE year for South African music, and next year will just get better. Some of our greatest music has come from artists who have shone bright in 2016. The Daily Vox rounds up five people who have done great things for South African music this year.Hlaudi Motsoeneng Okay we know you&#8217;re sceptical, but hear us out. Hlaudi is first on our list because he did something no other South African has done for the local industry: he has created a space for SA music on air. In May this year, the SABC announced they would have a trial period of three months in which their 18 stations played 90% local content. This ultimately opened up the industry for more local content to get airplay, be produced and be competitive.Black CoffeeThis year he shone bright at the BET Awards in Los Angeles where he scooped Best International Act &#8211; Africa. He beat the likes of AKA, Cassper Nyovest, Diamond Platnumz, MzVee, Serge Beynaud, Wizkid and Yemi Alade. He is the first South African to take home the award. In April, he rocked crowds at one of the USA&#8217;s biggest music festivals, Coachella.Congratulations Dj Black Coffee on yo Best International Act award @BET Los Angeles &#8230;. pic.twitter.com/zIZwloJ1Tu Spha Gumede (@Spha_Gruffy) June 28, 2016Sketchy BongoThe Durban-born producer started off working out of a studio at home. This where he produced some of the greatest music to come out of the country like Let You Know and Back to the Beach, which were released last year but gave way to his deal with Ultra and Sony Music in the USA. He and the creative collective from Durban, The Wolf Pack were flames this year and cannot wait for more good stuff next year.Congratulations to sketchy bongo, for landing a record deal with ultra and Sony Music.
