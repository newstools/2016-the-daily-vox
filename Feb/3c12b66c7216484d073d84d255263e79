Former SRC president at the North West University (NWU) Mafikeng campus, Linda “Benz” Mabengwane has been suspended by NWU for three years, following the outcome of a disciplinary hearing that took place on 15 and 16 February. In a statement released on Friday, NWU management said Mabengwane had been found guilty of five of the six charges brought against him. These include “the disruption of the registration process at the Mafikeng Campus on 25 January 2016, the assault of a fellow student on the same day, wilfully bringing the name of the university into disrepute by interfering with the rights of co-students in respect of the registration process in direct violation of the court interdict, interfering with the managerial functions of the management of the Mafikeng Campus, and engaging with the media on topics or activities that were designed to bring the NWU into disrepute.” EWN reported that university management had also opened a case against Mabengwane for violating a court interdict and allegedly assaulting another student during registration. He had been suspended from the university in January, pending the outcome of the disciplinary hearing. Speaking to The Daily Vox on Thursday, Mabengwane denied the charge of assault. Mabengwane has been given five working days within which he may appeal against the disciplinary process, the finding, or the suspension.
