There has been an outpouring of rage after black protesters were attacked by spectators and players at a rugby game a varsity game at the University of Free State (UFS) on Monday night. The scuffle broke out when when protesters interrupted a game between UFS and the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU), demanding an end to outsourced employment of cleaners at the institution. Multiple videos have circulated on social media showing how the brawl played out. I can’t find the words. That video gave me the chills and left me dumbfounded. #ufs #enoughisenough — Katlego (@Kat_esque) February 23, 2016  #UFS says they allowed rugby game to continue on the field as tensions had been addressed but clashes were taking place elesewhere on campus — Cathy Mohlahlana (@CathyMohlahlana) February 23, 2016  Since early 2015 South Africa’s university students and workers have set in motion the processes needed for deep and enduring social change. — Amandla!
