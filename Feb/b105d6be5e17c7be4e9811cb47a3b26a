The atmosphere at the Mafikeng campus of the North West University is still tense, after buildings were set alight on Wednesday night.
Parts of the administrative block, as well as the science building and a residence manager’s house were torched as students protested the inauguration of an SRC that they claim they did not elect. Government has meanwhile released a statement condemning events at the campus. Students were instructed to vacate residences by 12pm, after which they were told that they would be forcibly evacuated by police.

Mabengwane claimed that the SRC was dissolved on the basis of incapacity. He questioned who is responsible for deciding that the SRC is not performing, since it is elected by and reports to students. He claimed that SASCO circulated a petition calling for the dissolution of the SRC, which the EFF opposed. He asked where the students who support the dissolution of the SRC are, since it looks like the only students protesting on campus are in favour of the elected SRC.
