Blade Nzimande has been on Twitter (@DrBladeNzimande) for less than a week and already he’s got his foot firmly wedged in his mouth. DANA DA SILVA wonders if he understood what he was getting into when he dipped his toes into his particular pool. CONFIRMED the Twittter Account of Higher Education and Training Minister is 100% authentic – Follow him on @DrBladeNzimande Not Parody — RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) January 20, 2016  Ladies and gentlemen Minister of Higher Education @DrBladeNzimande is finally on Twitter. Be nice to him today at least. ? — Khaya Dlanga (@khayadlanga) January 20, 2016  Minister @DrBladeNzimande just followed us! We hope that this means you’re listening to our call for Free Decolonized Education! #Asinamali — WitsFeesMustFall (@WitsFMF) January 23, 2016  He probably should have kept on the kid gloves and stayed out of the ring, or hired a social media expert to work on his account. We are done engaging @DrBladeNzimande. Tonight was one of the examples that demonstrated to us why our country is in such deep crisis — WitsFeesMustFall (@WitsFMF) January 23, 2016  He then weighed in on decolonisation and Pan-Africanism. @WitsFMF For example, personally I believe in people’s education for people’s power and not ‘decolonization’. can we not debate this? — Bonginkosi Nzimande (@DrBladeNzimande) January 23, 2016  @TOMolefe @WitsFMF People’s education for people’s power is precisely the answer, not some narrow, backward pan Africanism with no support — Bonginkosi Nzimande (@DrBladeNzimande) January 23, 2016  @DrBladeNzimande what does that mean and how does it address the current concerns of a Euroccentric curriculum and black exclusion? @WitsFMF — the beard rider (@TOMolefe) January 23, 2016  @drbladenzimande @tomolefe @witsfmf Blade WTF do you know about people power?The same people your gov massacred in Marikana were exercising? — Wanelisa Xaba (@blak_terrorist) January 23, 2016  I hope you guys are following the exchange between @WitsFMF & @DrBladeNzimande. He says he’s not for decolonization pic.twitter.com/QbX89y8CrJ — Simamkele Dlakavu (@simamkeleD) January 23, 2016  Let us have a thorough debate on decolonization versus people’s education for people’s power. I reject anyone imposing thoughts on me — Bonginkosi Nzimande (@DrBladeNzimande) January 23, 2016  Have you read Mbembe on decolonisation and the pluriversity, @DrBladeNzimande? You should if you haven’t. https://t.co/MW18o164yn @WitsFMF — the beard rider (@TOMolefe) January 23, 2016  @TOMolefe @WitsFMF Why should I agree with Mbembe? I have my own independent thought. Why can’t I differ with Mbembe? — Bonginkosi Nzimande (@DrBladeNzimande) January 23, 2016  From the look of these debates, the students got Nzimande back for last year’s “Student’s must fall” comment.
