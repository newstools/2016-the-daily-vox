After a tumultuous year at the University of Oxford, #RhodesMustFall activist Ntokozo Qwabe is about to graduate from the elite British university. And he&#8217;s celebrating with a dance thats setting Facebook alight.Writing on Facebook, Qwabe said, &#8220;When you&#8217;ve been going through the most but are DONE with your Oxford exams forever and can smell your THIRD graduation!!! &#8220;So you dance to the Afrikan beat in your Oxford subfusc (which you are thankful you&#8217;ll never have to wear again cos you are officially Qwexiting the UK after two degrees &amp; two years of melanin slayage, causing havoc, decolonising &amp; all that jazz!).&#8220;Who said Afrikans abroad can&#8217;t move? Cos no matter where we are in the world we still got this thing in us. Sometimes our Afrikan moves, and general capacity to have fun &amp; get a lil silly are the only thing we got to deal with all of the things in this world. &#8220;Thank you to all the best people, classmates friends and comrades who have made the two years worth it. It&#8217;s been LIT! This is me signing out yall. BYE!!!&#8220;(side note: the dancing is a second slower than the music cos I videod myself but hopefully still decently in tune! and who cares anyways lol &#8211; we outchea DONE!)&#8221;Congratulations Ntokozo!
