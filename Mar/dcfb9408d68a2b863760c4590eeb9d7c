The Daily Vox aims to put the citizen at the centre of news. Our young reporters seek to find, curate and amplify the voices of young South Africans caught between the drudgery of old politics and new protectorates. Whereas the young are often at the periphery of traditional media, they are our priority. Not the officials and the experts but the people – be it in the city centre, the urban peripheries or the rural heartlands. We currently looking for: Assistant News Editor, Johannesburg
Description: A smart-arsed journalist/editor looking to break away from old routines. Come help us set the agenda. You need to be a team player and leader; will need to listen to young voices, be tech savvy and be looking to help build something great.  via GIPHY
