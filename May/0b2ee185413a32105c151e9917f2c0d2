We have all felt the pain of bunking school or work and being left with nothing but those Desmond Dube Clientele Life ads for company. Desmond Dube is quite the funny man, but most people would know him for his rather sombre daily presence on SA TV screens.Desmond Dube can either tell you that someday you&#8217;ll die or face a lawsuit but in both cases it&#8217;s a good idea to give him money. Thabang Wa Segafi (@kayn_li) May 12, 2016Despite his constant reminders of our mortality, Dube is actually an award-winning South African actor, writer and a producer. He received the Avanti award for best comedy actor in Joburg Blues, and a Loerie award for his role in the Sasol Amaglug-glug commercial. He is internationally recognised for appearances &#8211; besides the Clientele ads &#8211; in films, theatre productions and comedy shows. He performed in shows like Who Freed Nelson, Street Sisters, and Hotel Rwanda. He s even had his own comedy show, Dube on 2 . @Dubetv Shares excitement ahead of the #PayBackTheMoney premier.
