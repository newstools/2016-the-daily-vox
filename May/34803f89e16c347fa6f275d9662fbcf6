Annually, a day is set out to celebrate motherhood, maternal bonds and the influence of mothers in society. While motherhood is a beautiful journey for many, it isn t always cuddles and dancing little feet. MBALI PHALA caught up with a few moms on motherhood. &#8220;I try to walk my child to school often so he knows I&#8217;m trying my best and that I love him. I work far and sometimes by the time I get home, he&#8217;s already asleep. He&#8217;s a little soldier because he&#8217;s learnt to do things without me.&#8221; &#8220;Motherhood comes with a ton of sacrifices. Some days are harder than others but my baby and I are doing alright; we&#8217;re both new at this. I&#8217;m unemployed but I make sure we&#8217;re taken care of &#8211; part time jobs here and there, plus grant money.&#8221;&#8220;I had a baby when I was very young and you can only imagine how challenging the experience has been, but I wouldn&#8217;t change it for the world. I love my son. I have to get him ready for creche and drop him off every morning before school. It was so hard in the beginning, but I think I&#8217;m getting the hang of it. Raising a baby and going to school is no child&#8217;s play but I have to get an education.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m nervous about raising my little one, but what&#8217;s important is that I&#8217;m doing my best to make sure he&#8217;s a good child. Having a baby is expensive; have you seen the price of nappies? I planned ahead so we will be okay. My mom has also been supportive.&#8221; &#8220;Once a month or so I have to take an unpaid leave day from work to take my babies to the clinic. Motherhood is challenging but heartwarming. It&#8217;s the little things that make you feel broody.&#8221; &#8220;I have the privilege of helping my children get ready for school and walking them every morning. Many mothers aren&#8217;t able to do this because they have to rush to work on most mornings.&#8221;
