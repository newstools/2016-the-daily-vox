Like finding out about your own surprise party but still playing along? #StateCaptureReport Nate (@fyeahnate) November 2, 2016In December, Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas allegedly turned down R600, 000 in cash and R600 million in a bank account of his choice when the Gupta family offered Jonas the job of the new finance minister.Mr Mcebisi Jonas is a man of integrity. Turned down R600 million. Wow. #StateCaptureReport pic.twitter.com/8YXv6E669T S O B A H L E (@pearl_makhunga) November 2, 2016Jonas is now the posterchild of integrity in South Africa.Mr A Gupta asked Mr Jonas if he had a bag which he could use to receive and carry R600m and he declined the money. WOW! #StateCaptureReport pic.twitter.com/A5RUC9Mnfm Mooks (@Mooks_z) November 2, 2016Folks on Twitter are feeling the loss of the money that Jonas turned down.I&#8217;m so broke I wish the #Guptas can capture me with just R1000000. And I always have my bag with me, actually 2 bags. #StateCaptureReport Pius Khalid Muhammad (@Pius_Ngobs) November 2, 2016As for Vytjie Mentor, now we know why she opposed the interdict against the release of the report in court on Tuesday.#StateCaptureReport it&#8217;s lit!!!

DubbleH33lix (@DubbleH33lix) November 2, 2016The Guptas have BEEN making money off the state.#StateCaptureReport Jonas interview: He (Ajay Gupta) mentioned that collectively as a family, they made a lot of money from the State &#8230; TheGabbzter (@TheGabbsta) November 2, 2016*furiously turns to page 96*honestly I&#8217;m enjoying page 96 of the #StateCaptureReport. that conversation Zuma had with Maseko deserves a screening on #SkeemSam Mandla Gingirikani (@mandlamZA) November 2, 2016As for Jacob Zuma:Predictably, the DA (and most of the country, to be fair) is not impressed with JZ.The manner in which Jacob Zuma has conducted himself is dishonourable &amp; unbecoming of SA&#8217;s President. &#8211; @MmusiMaimane #StateCaptureReport Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) November 2, 2016Will Zuma step down? If there s anyone who has nine lives If the ANC does not recall Jacob Zuma right now, they are the worst too.
