But at least people will be looking at the sky. best time to view the supermoon. &#8211; cape town 19:25 &#8211; johannesburg 18:33 &#8211; durban 18:26basically just after sunset.&mdash; cozy. (@el_teee_) November 14, 2016On the evening of November 14 2016, people on Earth will see something that hasn&#8217;t been seen since 1948 &#8211; a supermoon. The supermoon is what happens when the moon is both in full moon phase, and closest to the Earth. You see, the moon&#8217;s orbit of Earth isn&#8217;t perfectly circular, but more kind of rugby ball-shaped, and so we&#8217;ll witness it on the closest point that it will be on its orbit of Earth.Don t miss out on tonight s supermoon- the closest full moon to Earth since 1948! We won t see another until 2034 https://t.co/FAV49tMjxG pic.twitter.com/cgeabvZDV4&mdash; SANSA (@SANSA7) November 14, 2016But according to an expert, a supermoon isn&#8217;t really a massive astronomical deal.&#8220;There&#8217;s usually a lot of hype about the supermoon when it&#8217;s really a non-event. If you do actually measure, it can be slightly bigger and brighter, tides may be slightly higher than normal &#8211; but it&#8217;s not a big deal,&#8221; says Case Rijsdijk, Vice-President of the Astronomical Society of Southern Africa (ASSA).The next supermoon under the same conditions is projected to happen again in 2033.Rijsdijk says that people tend to make a fuss over it, when it&#8217;s just a full moon &#8211; something that happens every month. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very beautiful powerful moon rising, yes, but really it&#8217;s just another full moon.&#8221;He says that for the most part, a larger appearance will be more of an optical illusion than anything else. &#8220;If you watch it rise it will appear bigger. The rising full moon always looks bigger than it does in the sky, and that&#8217;s an optical illusion.&#8221;&#8220;It&#8217;s really not a significant thing at all. It may be slightly bigger. It may be slightly higher. But you could probably only tell that with a telescope.&#8221;&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge hype. Maybe the only good thing about it is that people will look up and look at the sky for a change.&#8221;So, there you have it. It may not be that significant astronomically, but we still love enjoying a pretty sight. Will you be viewing the supermoon? Tweet us your sightings of it!
