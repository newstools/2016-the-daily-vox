On Monday morning, Wits students started protesting on the streets of Parktown, blocking Oxford Road with rocks and burning tyres. The students then moved outside the Knockando Residence on Rockridge Road, where rubber bullets and stun grenades were fired into the residence. Hankyeol Lee captured these images. &nbsp;&nbsp;
